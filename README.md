Bank Marketing Project

This project analyzes the Bank Marketing Dataset to uncover patterns influencing term deposit subscriptions.
Using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn) and Power BI, we explore customer demographics, campaign effectiveness, and financial behavior.

Key Steps
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – handled missing values, encoded categorical data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – visualized trends in subscription rates by age, education, marital status, call duration, and contact method.

Machine Learning Models – applied classification algorithms to predict deposit subscriptions.

Power BI Dashboard – interactive visualizations for campaign performance and customer segmentation.

Tech Stack
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Power BI: Dashboard & KPI tracking

Insights
Longer call durations and previous successful contacts significantly increase subscription likelihood.

Certain months and contact methods yield higher conversion rates.
